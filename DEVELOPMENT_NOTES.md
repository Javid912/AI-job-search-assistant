# Multi-Agent Application Design for Job Search Automation

## **Introduction**
This document serves as an educational guide and reference for building a multi-agent system to automate job search workflows. The project integrates AI-driven tools to streamline tasks like searching for job postings, extracting and storing information, automating email communication, and scheduling interviews. It provides an overview of the design choices, tools, and workflows, ensuring clarity and ease of use throughout development.

## **Project Overview**
### **Objectives**
1. **Automate Job Search**: Collect job postings from platforms like Glassdoor, Google Jobs, or company websites.
2. **Data Extraction**: Extract relevant information such as job descriptions and recruiter contacts.
3. **Centralized Storage**: Store data in a structured format, like a CSV file or database.
4. **Email Workflow Automation**: Generate, send, and track emails, including follow-ups.
5. **Interview Scheduling**: Integrate with tools like Google Calendar to manage interview appointments.

## **Key Concepts**
### **1. Multi-Agent Systems**
A multi-agent system involves multiple autonomous agents working collaboratively to achieve a set of tasks. Agents in this project include:
- **Data Collection Agent**: Scrapes job postings.
- **Information Extraction Agent**: Parses and organizes relevant data.
- **Communication Agent**: Automates email workflows.
- **Scheduler Agent**: Books and manages interviews.

### **2. Tools and APIs**
- **CrewAI**: Provides specialized multi-agent frameworks and tools for automation.
- **LangChain**: Facilitates building and orchestrating agents with custom workflows.
- **LLMs (e.g., OpenAI, LLaMA)**: Generates text, analyzes data, and drafts emails.
- **APIs**: Includes search APIs (Google Search, SerpAPI), email APIs (SMTP, Gmail API), and scraping APIs (e.g., OmniParser).

### **3. Data Storage**
Data is stored in a database (PostgreSQL) or CSV files for simplicity and accessibility.

## **System Architecture**
### **Design Overview**
![System Architecture Diagram](https://via.placeholder.com/800x400) *(Placeholder for architecture graphic)*

1. **Data Ingestion**:
   - Sources: Job platforms, company websites.
   - Tools: Web scraping APIs (CrewAI tools or Selenium), RAG search integrations.

2. **Data Processing**:
   - Parsing tools: OmniParser or custom scripts.
   - Storage: PostgreSQL database or CSV files.

3. **Automation Agents**:
   - Workflow orchestration via LangChain or CrewAI’s agent framework.
   - Email generation using LLMs.

4. **Scheduling**:
   - Calendar integration (Google Calendar API).
   - Response tracking and follow-ups.

## **Tool Comparison and Selection**
### **CrewAI vs. LangChain**
| Feature                  | CrewAI                                         | LangChain                                |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Ease of Use**          | Pre-built workflows for rapid deployment.     | High customization, requires more setup. |
| **Integration**          | Limited to ecosystem tools.                   | Broad support for APIs and tools.        |
| **Community Support**    | Growing but smaller community.                | Large, active community.                 |
| **Flexibility**          | Ideal for conversational workflows.           | Suitable for complex, modular systems.   |

**Recommendation**: Begin with CrewAI for simplicity. Transition to LangChain if flexibility is required.

### **APIs and Tools**
- **Web Scraping**: Selenium, OmniParser, CrewAI scraping tools.
- **Email Automation**: SMTP libraries, Gmail API.
- **Scheduling**: Google Calendar API.
- **Storage**: PostgreSQL, CSV.

## **Development Roadmap**
### **Phase 1: Research and Setup**
- Identify suitable APIs for job search and data scraping.
- Set up the development environment (Docker for containerization, PostgreSQL for storage).
- Explore multi-agent frameworks (CrewAI, LangChain).

### **Phase 2: Data Collection**
- Implement data collection agents using web scraping tools.
- Store collected data in a structured format.

### **Phase 3: Workflow Automation**
- Develop agents for email generation and responses.
- Integrate with Google Calendar for scheduling.

### **Phase 4: Testing and Iteration**
- Test the system end-to-end with sample workflows.
- Refine agent behavior and data flows.

### **Phase 5: Deployment and Maintenance**
- Deploy the system locally or on a server.
- Monitor performance and optimize as needed.
